This sub-plugin allows Admins to add postcode lookup functionality to signup forms on the DLE.

Steps to activate:

1 - An account with a postcode lookup webservice is required. Currently, the plugin supports http://www.postcodesoftware.co.uk/
    This is a paid service, costing Â£44 per year.
2 - You will need to add user profile fields (Site Administration > Users > Accounts > User Profile Fields) to support the data returned
    by the webservice. The service will find Premise details (Address 1 - Address 4), Town and Country. You will need to add a postcode field
    as a minimum, but other fields are optional. You should use Text Input as the field type and you should select the option to display each
    field on the signup page.
3 - You will need to add authentication details and tell the plugin how to map to the new profile fields. Browse to 
    Site Administration > Learning Pool > Postcode Lookup and add your account details, the url to the webservice and add the shortnames
    for each of the profile fields to map them to the appropriate address fields. Finally, check the box to enable the lookup button.

When you've done all this, you can browse to <sitename>/login/signup.php and you'll see that the postcode field is now shown on the
signup form along with a button to look up the address. If the service finds a result, it will display a dropdown of house numbers
that the user can select from, accept and the rest of the address details will be automatically populated into the form. The user also
has the option of editing those fields after having used the lookup service.
